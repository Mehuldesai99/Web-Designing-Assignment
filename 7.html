<!-- 7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? -->

<!-- - The id attribute and the class attribute in HTML serve different purposes, even though they both provide a way to identify and apply styles to HTML elements.

1. id Attribute:

- The id attribute is used to provide a unique identifier for a specific HTML element on a page.

- An element's id should be unique within the HTML document, meaning no other element should have the same id.

- It is often used when JavaScript needs to manipulate or interact with a specific element uniquely.

- The id attribute is specified as follows:

<tagname id="uniqueIdentifier">Content</tagname>

Example:

<div id="header">This is a header.</div>

- In this example, the id attribute "header" uniquely identifies the <div> element.

2. class Attribute:
    
    - The class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element.
    
    - It allows multiple elements to share the same class, enabling consistent styling or applying similar behavior to those elements.
    
    - Unlike the id attribute, the same class name can be used on multiple elements within the HTML document.
    
    - The class attribute is specified as follows:

    <tagname class="classname1 classname2 ...">Content</tagname>

Example:

<p class="highlight">This paragraph has a special highlight class.</p>

- In this example, the <p> element has the class attribute with the value "highlight."

    - In summary, the key differences are:
    
    - id should be unique within the HTML document, while the same class can be applied to multiple elements.
    - id is often used for unique identification and interaction with JavaScript.
    - class is used for grouping elements that share common styles or behavior. -->

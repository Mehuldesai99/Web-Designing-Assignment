<!-- 11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

- Block-level elements and inline elements are two types of HTML elements, and they differ in how they are displayed and interact with other elements on a web page.

>>> Block-level elements:

1. Display:
- Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available, extending the entire width of their container.
They create a "block" or a rectangular box in the layout flow.

2. Structure:
- Block-level elements are structural elements that are used to define the main sections of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, divs, lists, and more.

3. Usage:
- They are used to create the overall structure of a web page and group content into logical sections.
Examples of block-level elements:

- <div>
- <p>
- <h1> to <h6>
- <ul>, <ol>, <li>
- <table>, <tr>, <td>
- <form>
etc.

>>> Inline elements:

1. Display:
- Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much 
width as necessary.
- They flow within the content, appearing inline with the surrounding text or elements.

2. Structure:
- Inline elements are used to style and format specific parts of the content without creating distinct blocks.

3. Usage:
- They are often used for styling and formatting within a block-level element. For example, applying styles to individual words or phrases within a paragraph.

- Examples of inline elements:

- <span>
- <a>
- <strong>, <em>
- <img>
- <br>
- <i>, <b>
etc.

- In summary, the primary difference lies in their display behavior and structural role. Block-level elements create block structures, while inline elements flow within the content. Understanding the distinction is crucial for effective HTML and CSS styling and layout. -->

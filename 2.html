<!--2. What are tags and attributes in HTML? -->

<!-- >>> In HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), tags and attributes are fundamental concepts used to structure and define the content of a web page.

1.HTML Tags:

>>> Tags are the basic building blocks of HTML.
>>> They define elements on a web page and are enclosed in angle brackets (< >).
>>> Tags typically come in pairsâ€”an opening tag and a closing tag.
>>> The opening tag marks the beginning of an element, and the closing tag marks the end.
>>> Example: <p> (opening tag) and </p> (closing tag) together define a paragraph element.

ex:-   <p>This is a paragraph.</p>



2. HTML Attributes:

>>> Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
>>> They are always included in the opening tag of an element.
>>> Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=), and the value is enclosed in quotes.
>>> Example: In <a href="https://www.example.com">, href is the attribute name, and "https://www.example.com" is its value.

ex:-    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>



>>> In the above example, the <a> tag is used to create a hyperlink, and the href attribute specifies the URL to which the link points.

>>> Overall, HTML tags define the structure and content of elements, while attributes provide additional information or settings for those elements. Combining tags and attributes allows you to create a well-structured and interactive web page. -->

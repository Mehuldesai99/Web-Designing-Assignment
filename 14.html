<!-- 14. What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

- The <span> tag in HTML is a generic container element that is used to apply styles or scripting to a specific section of text within a larger block of content. It doesn't have any inherent semantic meaning and is often used for styling or scripting purposes.

- Here's the basic syntax of the <span> tag:

    <span>Text or content to be styled</span>

- You can apply CSS styles or JavaScript functions to the content within the <span> tags. Here's an example demonstrating the use of the <span> tag for styling:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Span Tag Example</title>
    <style>
        .highlight {
            color: red;
            font-weight: bold;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> word in a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

- In this example, the <span> tag is used to surround the word "highlighted." The CSS style defined in the <style> section targets the class "highlight" and applies a red color and bold font weight to the text within the <span> element. This allows you to apply styles to specific portions of text without affecting the entire paragraph. -->

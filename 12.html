<!--12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? -->

<!-- - In HTML, you can create a hyperlink using the <a> (anchor) element. Here's the basic syntax for creating a hyperlink:

    <a href="URL">Link Text</a>

- Here, "URL" is the web address or the destination where you want the link to point, and "Link Text" is the text that will be displayed as the clickable link.

- Here's a simple example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hyperlink Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Click the link below:</h1>

<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>

</body>
</html>

- In this example, when the user clicks on the link with the text "Visit Example.com," the browser will navigate to the URL specified in the href attribute (in this case, "https://www.example.com").

- You can also create links to other pages within the same website by specifying relative URLs. For example:

<a href="/page2.html">Go to Page 2</a>

- In this case, the link points to a page named "page2.html" in the same directory as the current HTML file.

- Additionally, you can use the target attribute to specify how the linked page should be displayed. For example, you can open the link in a new browser tab or window:

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example.com in a new tab</a>

- The target="_blank" attribute value will open the link in a new browser tab. -->

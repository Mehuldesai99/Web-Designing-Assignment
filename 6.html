<!-- 6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? -->
<!-- 
>> In HTML, the class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. Classes are a way to apply styles or behavior to multiple elements with a single identifier. The class attribute can be applied to various HTML elements, including but not limited to, <div>, <span>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <a>, and others.

>> The syntax for adding the class attribute to an HTML element is as follows:

<tagname class="classname1 classname2 ...">Content</tagname>
    
>> tagname: The HTML tag to which the class attribute is applied.
classname1, classname2, etc.: One or more class names separated by spaces.

<p class="highlight">This paragraph has a special highlight class.</p>

>> In this example, the paragraph (<p>) has a class attribute with the value "highlight." The class name "highlight" can then be associated with specific styles in a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file, allowing for consistent styling across multiple elements.

    .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
        font-weight: bold;
      }

>> In the accompanying CSS rule, any element with the class "highlight" will have a yellow background color and bold font weight. The class attribute provides a way to group and style HTML elements based on common characteristics or functionality. -->

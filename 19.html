<!-- 19. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to structure content on the web, but they have some differences in syntax and rules. Here are key distinctions between HTML and XHTML:

1. Syntax:
- HTML: HTML has a more lenient syntax. Tags can be written in uppercase or lowercase, and there is more flexibility in how tags are closed (e.g., <tag> or <tag></tag>).
- XHTML: XHTML has a stricter syntax based on XML rules. All tags must be written in lowercase, and they must be properly nested and closed. XHTML requires self-closing tags for elements like <img> and <br>.

2. Document Structure:
- HTML: HTML documents may not necessarily be well-formed XML documents. For example, HTML does not require that all tags be closed or that elements be properly nested.
- XHTML: XHTML documents must adhere to well-formed XML rules, including properly nested and closed tags. This means that every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag.

3. Attribute Quoting:
- HTML: Attribute values can be written without quotes, and it is common to see attributes like <input type=text> or <a href=index.html>.
- XHTML: Attribute values must be enclosed in double or single quotes, and it follows a more strict syntax like <input type="text"> or <a href="index.html">.

4. Error Handling:
- HTML: HTML is forgiving of errors, and browsers often try to render the content even if there are syntax mistakes.
- XHTML: XHTML is less forgiving of errors. If there are syntax errors, browsers may not render the content, and the document may not be displayed as intended.

5. Content Type:
- HTML: HTML is generally served as text/html.
- XHTML: XHTML is served as application/xhtml+xml or application/xml.

6. Compatibility:
- HTML: HTML is widely supported by browsers, and older versions of HTML are well-supported across various platforms.
- XHTML: Due to its strict syntax, XHTML may have compatibility issues with older browsers, especially if served with the application/xhtml+xml content type. -->

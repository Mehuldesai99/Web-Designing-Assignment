<!-- 16. How are active links different from normal links?

- Active links and normal links refer to different states of a hyperlink based on user interaction. Here are the key differences:

1. Normal Links:
- Normal links refer to the default state of a hyperlink when it is not being interacted with by the user.
- In the normal state, the link text is typically styled according to the default link styles set by the browser or any custom styles applied through CSS.
- When the user hovers over a normal link, it may change color, underline, or show some other visual indication, depending on the CSS styles applied.

2. Active Links:
- Active links refer to the state of a hyperlink when it is currently being clicked or activated by the user.
- The active state is usually a brief moment when the user clicks on the link, and it is in the process of being activated.
- You can apply specific styles to the active link using the :active pseudo-class in CSS. For example, you might change the link text color or background color during the brief time when it is being clicked.
- Example CSS for styling active links:

/* Normal link styles */
a {
    color: blue;
    text-decoration: underline;
}

/* Active link styles */
a:active {
    color: red;
    background-color: yellow;
}

- In this example, the link is blue with an underline in its normal state. When the link is actively being clicked (:active state), it will turn red with a yellow background.

- Understanding and appropriately styling both normal and active link states can enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback during user interaction. -->

<!-- 4. What are HTML Entities? -->

<!-- >>> HTML entities are special codes or sequences of characters used to represent reserved characters, special symbols, and characters with a specific meaning in HTML. They are often used to display characters that might otherwise be interpreted as HTML code or to represent characters that are not easily typable on a standard keyboard.

HTML entities are composed of an ampersand (&), followed by a specific code or name, and ending with a semicolon (;). The general syntax is &entity_name; or &#entity_number;.

<!-- 20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?


- In HTML, the terms "logical tags" and "physical tags" are not commonly used. However, it's possible that you are referring to the concepts of "semantic elements" and "presentational elements."

1. Semantic Elements (Logical Tags):
- Semantic elements are HTML tags that carry meaning about the structure and content of the document.
- They convey the intended meaning of the content to both browsers and developers.
- Examples of semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>, etc.
- Semantic elements help improve the document's structure, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO).

- Example:

<article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>Article content goes here...</p>
</article>

2. Presentational Elements (Physical Tags):

- Presentational elements (or non-semantic elements) are HTML tags that traditionally were used for formatting and styling, without conveying specific meaning about the content.
- Examples include <b> for bold text, <i> for italic text, <font> for font styling, and <center> for centering content.
- These tags have been deprecated in favor of using CSS for styling and presentation, separating content and presentation concerns.

- Example (deprecated presentational usage):

<p>This is <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> text.</p>

- In modern web development, the emphasis is on using semantic elements for better document structure, accessibility, and maintainability. CSS is then employed to handle the presentation and styling of the content. This separation of concerns makes the HTML code cleaner and more focused on the document's structure and meaning. -->

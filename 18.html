<!-- 18. What is SVG?

- SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based vector image format for describing two-dimensional graphics. SVG is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable.

- Key features of SVG include:

1. Vector Graphics: SVG images are based on mathematical expressions to define shapes, rather than pixels. This allows them to be scaled to any size without loss of quality, making them well-suited for responsive web design.

2. XML-based: SVG is written in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which makes it compatible with other web technologies and allows it to be easily embedded within HTML documents.

3. Interactive Elements: SVG supports interactive elements and animations. You can use JavaScript to manipulate and animate SVG elements, making it suitable for creating dynamic and interactive web graphics.

4. Accessibility: SVG images can be styled and scripted using CSS and JavaScript, making them accessible and easy to work with for web developers.

5. Wide Browser Support: Most modern web browsers support SVG, making it a versatile choice for web developers.

6. Applications: SVG is commonly used for a variety of purposes on the web, including logos, icons, charts, maps, and illustrations. It is also used in combination with CSS and JavaScript for creating complex and interactive graphics.

- Here is a simple example of an SVG image:

<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>

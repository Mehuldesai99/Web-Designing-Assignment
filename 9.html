<!-- 9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?

- In HTML tables, cell padding and cell spacing are attributes that define the space around the content of a table cell and the space between cells, respectively. They are used to control the visual appearance of tables.

1. Cell Padding:

- cellpadding is an attribute that defines the amount of space between the content of a table cell and its borders.

- It is specified as an attribute within the <table> tag.

- The value of cellpadding is usually set in pixels or as a percentage of the cell width.

Example:
<table cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
- In this example, each cell in the table will have padding of 10 pixels around its content.

2. Cell Spacing:
  
- cellspacing is an attribute that defines the space between cells in a table.
  
- Like cellpadding, it is specified as an attribute within the <table> tag.
  
- The value of cellspacing is usually set in pixels or as a percentage of the cell width.
  
Example:  
<table cellspacing="5">
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  - In this example, there will be a 5-pixel space between the cells of the table.

  - In summary:
  
  - Cell Padding: Defines the space between the content of a table cell and its borders.
  - Cell Spacing: Defines the space between adjacent cells in a table.

  - Both attributes contribute to the visual layout of tables, and their values are usually set to create a visually appealing and readable table structure. It's important to note that these attributes are considered somewhat outdated, and modern web design often utilizes CSS for styling and layout instead of HTML attributes.   -->

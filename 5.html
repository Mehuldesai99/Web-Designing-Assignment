<!-- 5. What are different types of lists in HTML? -->

<!-- >> HTML provides several types of lists to organize and structure content. The main types of lists are:

1. Ordered List (<ol>):

    An ordered list is used to represent a list of items in a specific order.
    
    Each list item is marked with a number or another ordered list-specific marker.
    
Example:
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

2. Unordered List (<ul>):

    An unordered list is used to represent a list of items without any specific order.
    
    Each list item is typically marked with a bullet point or another unordered list-specific marker.
    
Example:
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>
3. Definition List (<dl>):

    A definition list is used to represent a list of terms and their definitions.
    
    It consists of terms (<dt> - definition term) and their corresponding definitions (<dd> - definition description).
    
Example:
    <dl>
        <dt>Term 1</dt>
        <dd>Definition 1</dd>
        <dt>Term 2</dt>
        <dd>Definition 2</dd>
      </dl>
             -->
